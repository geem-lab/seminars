**Things to do and check:**

- [ ] I inserted the **seminar title** (in the title bar above).
  - [ ] I **did not** remove the `[SEMINAR]` part of the title.
- [ ] I inserted a **short description** (in this text area above).
- [ ] I edited the **date** (in this text area above).
- [ ] I assigned the **speaker** (on the right sidebar).
- [ ] I ticked those checkboxes either *after* or *while* creating the issue.

> The **date** is when the seminar will take place. If you're unsure about the seminar **speaker**, it's probably *you*.
