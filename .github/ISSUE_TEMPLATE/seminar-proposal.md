**Things to do and check:**

- [ ] I inserted the **seminar title** (in the title bar above).
  - [ ] I did not remove the `[SEMINAR] ` part of the title.
- [ ] I inserted a **short description** (in this text area).
- [ ] I assigned the **speaker** (on the right sidebar).
- [ ] I assigned a **due date** (on the right sidebar).

> The **due date** is when the seminar will take place. If you're unsure about the seminar **speaker**, it's probably *yourself*.
